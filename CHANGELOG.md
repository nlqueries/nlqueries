# Changelog

All notable changes to `nlqueries-core` are documented here. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.0] — Initial release

First public release of NLQueries Core.

### Added

- Natural-language-to-SQL query engine with two access modes: `query` (executes and returns results) and `ask` (previews validated SQL without executing)
- Database connectors: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, SQL Server / Azure SQL, DuckDB
- Document connectors: PDF, Word, Excel, Notion, Confluence — with a document agent and hybrid SQL+document routing
- Query pipeline (`process-history`, `annotate`) that builds a YAML knowledge base from schema and query history
- `kb-stats` command for knowledge base coverage and quality reporting
- Semantic cache backed by Qdrant, and an embedding daemon (`embed-server`) to avoid per-invocation model load latency
- Connector aliases, `health` service-check command, local JSONL feedback store (`feedback`, `feedback-stats`)
- MCP server exposing query execution and schema/knowledge lookup as tools for MCP-compatible AI assistants
- CLI available as both `nlqueries` and `nlq`
- Docker Compose stack (Qdrant + core service) using the published [`nlqueries/core`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nlqueries/core) image

### Known limitations

- Python 3.14+ is not supported for document ingestion (`doc-ingest`, `doc-sync-notion`, `doc-sync-confluence`) — see [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md#w6--pydantic-v1-incompatibility-python-314)
- `--days` has no effect on PostgreSQL query history (`pg_stat_statements` doesn't record per-query timestamps) — see [docs/connectors.md](docs/connectors.md#postgresql--enabling-query-history-capture)
